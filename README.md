The backend was written in Python using the Flask microframework, and a SQL relational database of [UMLS concepts] (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) was used to hierarchically organise the biomedical concepts. The software architecture, implementation of the numerous components of the application, and an evaluation of the system are detailed in the [project report] (https://github.com/agutteridge/Project/tree/master/Project Report).
