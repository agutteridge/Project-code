The backend was written in Python using the Flask microframework, and a SQL relational database of UMLS concepts (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) was used to hierarchically organise the biomedical concepts. The software architecture, implementation of the numerous components of the application, and an evaluation of the system are detailed in the project report (https://github.com/agutteridge/Project/tree/master/Project Report).
