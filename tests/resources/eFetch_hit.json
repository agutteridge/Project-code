            "The hyperinflammatory syndrome hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can occur in the context of malignancies. Malignancy-triggered hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis should be regarded seperately from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis during chemotherapeutic treatment, which is frequently associated with an infectious trigger. The substantial overlap between the features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with features of neoplasms makes its identification difficult when it occurs in malignant conditions. To facilitate recognition and diagnostic workup, and provide guidance regarding the treatment of malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, consensus recommendations were developed by the Study Group on Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Subtypes of the Histiocyte Society, an interdisciplinary group consisting of pediatric and adult hemato-oncologists and immunologists."

            "MicroRNAs are emerging to be important epigenetic factors that control axon regeneration. Here, we report that microRNA-26a (miR-26a) is a physiological regulator of mammalian axon regeneration in vivo. We demonstrated that endogenous miR-26a acted to target specifically glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in adult mouse sensory neurons in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of endogenous miR-26a in sensory neurons impaired axon regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the regulatory effect of miR-26a was mediated by increased expression of GSK3β because downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β fully rescued axon regeneration. Our results also suggested that the miR-26a-GSK3β pathway regulated axon regeneration at the neuronal soma by controlling gene expression. We provided biochemical and functional evidences that the regeneration-associated transcription factor Smad1 acted downstream of miR-26a and GSK3β to control sensory axon regeneration. Our study reveals a novel miR-26a-GSK3β-Smad1 signaling pathway in the regulation of mammalian axon regeneration. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that, in addition to inhibition of GSK3β kinase activity, maintaining a lower protein level of GSK3β in neurons by the microRNA is necessary for efficient axon regeneration."

            "This review summarizes significant recent advances in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism.",
            "The apparent incidence of congenital hypothyroidism has more than doubled in recent years because of several factors, including more inclusive diagnostic criteria, shifting demographics, and increasing survival of preterm infants. The greatest increase has occurred in mildly affected patients, many of whom have a eutopic thyroid gland. Congenital hypothyroidism may be transient or persistent, but the natural history cannot be predicted by severity at diagnosis. In premature infants, who are especially vulnerable to hypothyroidism, the rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone may be delayed and therefore detected only by routine follow-up screening. Recent studies of defects in thyroid hormone synthesis have focused on the role of mutations in the dual oxidase system and of a novel apical iodide transporter, anoctamin 1. Finally, emerging data suggest that exposure to excess thyroid hormone may be as harmful as hypothyroidism to long-term cognitive development.",
            "Although newborn screening has virtually eradicated mental retardation due to congenital hypothyroidism in parts of the world, new information continues to accumulate and new questions to arise about the diagnosis, physiology, and optimal management of this disorder."

            "Lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment for obesity despite the lack of substantial long-term efficacy. For many who do not respond to lifestyle therapy and are not candidates for weight loss surgery, pharmacotherapy is a viable treatment option. Advances in understanding mechanisms of appetite control, nutrient sensing, and energy expenditure have not only helped shape current drug development but have also changed the way in which antiobesity medications are prescribed. Current antiobesity medications and pharmacological strategies will be reviewed.",
            "Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity.

            "Polymorphisms in the IRGM gene, associated with Crohn disease (CD) and tuberculosis, are among the earliest identified examples documenting the role of autophagy in human disease. Functional studies have shown that IRGM protects against these diseases by modulating autophagy, yet the exact molecular mechanism of IRGM's activity has remained unknown. We have recently elucidated IRGM's mechanism of action. IRGM functions as a platform for assembling, stabilizing, and activating the core autophagic machinery, while at the same time physically coupling it to conventional innate immunity receptors. Exposure to microbial products or bacterial invasion increases IRGM expression, which leads to stabilization of AMPK. Specific protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination of IRGM, lead to a co-assembly with IRGM of the key autophagy regulators ULK1 and BECN1 in their activated forms. IRGM physically interacts with two other CD risk factors, ATG16L1 and NOD2, placing these three principal players in CD within the same molecular complex. This explains how polymorphisms altering expression or function of any of the three factors individually can affect the same process - autophagy. Furthermore, IRGM's interaction with NOD2, and additional pattern recognition receptors such as NOD1, RIG-I and select TLRs, transduces microbial signals to the core autophagy apparatus. This work solves the long-standing enigma of how IRGM controls autophagy."

            "Despite the lack of placebo-controlled trials, glucocorticoids are considered the mainstay of initial treatment for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and myositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Glucocorticoid-sparing agents are often given concomitantly with other immunosuppressive agents, particularly in patients with moderate or severe disease. First-line conventional immunosuppressive drugs include either methotrexate or azathioprine, and when they fail, more aggressive therapy includes mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus or cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, or cyclophosphamide, used alone or in various combinations. Further investigations are required to assess the role of more novel therapies in the treatment of myositis and myositis-associated interstitial lung disease."

            "Microfluidic devices employ submillimeter length scale control of flow to achieve high-resolution spatial and temporal control over the microenvironment, providing powerful tools to elucidate mechanisms of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) regulation and to elicit desired hPSC fates. In addition, microfluidics allow control of paracrine and juxtracrine signaling, thereby enabling fabrication of microphysiological systems comprised of multiple cell types organized into organs-on-a-chip. Microfluidic cell culture systems can also be integrated with actuators and sensors, permitting construction of high-density arrays of cell-based biosensors for screening applications. This review describes recent advances in using microfluidics to understand mechanisms by which the microenvironment regulates hPSC fates and applications of microfluidics to realize the potential of hPSCs for in vitro modeling and screening applications."

            "Mobile health may be an effective means of providing access and education to the millions of homeless Americans. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 homeless people from different shelters in New York City to evaluate their perceptions, attitudes, and experiences regarding mobile health. Participants' average age was 51.66 (SD = 11.34) years; duration of homelessness was 2.0 (SD = 3.10) years. The majority had a mobile phone with the ability to receive and send text messages. Most participants attempted to maintain the same phone number over time. The homeless were welcoming and supportive of text messaging regarding health care issues, including appointment reminders, health education, or management of diseases considering their barriers and mobility, and believed it would help them access necessary health care. Overwhelmingly they preferred text reminders that were short, positively framed, and directive in nature compared to lengthy or motivational texts. The majority believed that free cell phone plans would improve their engagement with, help them navigate, and ultimately improve their access to care. These positive attitudes and experience could be effectively used to improve health care for the homeless. Policies to improve access to mobile health and adapted text messaging strategies regarding the health care needs of this mobile population should be considered."

            "Sediments in navigation-dominated waterways are frequently contaminated with a variety of particle-associated pollutants and are subject to frequent short-term resuspension events. There is little information documenting whether resuspension of metal-contaminated sediments has adverse ecological effects on resident aquatic organisms. Using a novel laboratory approach, we examined the mobilization of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr during resuspension of a freshwater and two coastal marine sediments and whether resuspension and redeposition resulted in toxicity to model organisms. Sediment flux exposure chambers (SeFEC) were used to resuspend metal-contaminated sediments from one site in Lake DePue, Illinois, and two sites in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine. Short-term (4 h) resuspension of sediment at environmentally relevant suspended particulate matter concentrations (< 1 g/L) resulted in metal mobilization to water that was sediment and metal specific. Overall, the net release of metals from suspended particles was limited, likely due to scavenging by organic matter and Fe oxides that formed during sediment interaction with oxic water. Minimal toxicity to organisms (survival of Hyalella azteca and Daphnia magna; survival, growth, and tissue metal concentration of Neanthes arenaceodentata; bioluminescence of Pyrocystis lunula) was observed during 4-h exposure to resuspended sediments and during 4- to 10-d post-exposure recovery periods in uncontaminated water. Redeposited suspended particles exhibited increased metal bioavailability and toxicity to H. azteca, highlighting the potential for adverse ecological impacts due to changes in metal speciation. It is important to consider interactions between organisms' life histories and sediment disturbance regimes when assessing risks to ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright.

            "Understanding direct response of insects to elevated CO2 should help to elucidate the mechanistic bases of the effects of elevated CO2 on interactions of insects with plants. This should improve our ability to predict shifts in insect population dynamics and community interactions under the conditions of climate change. Effects of elevated CO2 levels on the fitness-related parameters were examined for multigenerations in the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée). The larvae were allowed to feed on artificial diet, and reared in the closed-dynamic environment chambers with three CO2 levels (ambient, 550 μl/liter, and 750 μl/liter) for six generations. In comparison with the ambient CO2 level, mean larval survival rate decreased 9.9% in 750 μl/liter CO2 level, across O. furnacalis generations, and larval and pupal development times increased 7.5-16.4% and 4.5-13.4%, respectively, in two elevated CO2 levels. Pupal weight was reduced more than 12.2% in 750 μl/liter CO2 level. Across O. furnacalis generations, mean food consumption per larva increased 2.7, 7.0% and frass excretion per larva increased 14.4, 22.5% in the two elevated CO2 levels, respectively, compared with ambient CO2 level. Elevated CO2 levels resulted in the decline mean across O. furnacalis generations in mean relative growth rate, but increased in relative consumption rate. These results suggested that elevated CO2 would reduce the fitness-related parameters such as higher mortality, lower pupal weight, and longer development times in long term. It also reduced the larval food digestibility and utilizing efficiency; in turn, this would result in increase of food consumption."

            "Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), a worldwide distributive invasive pest, originated from the United States, and it was first reported in Guangdong province, China, in 2008. The effects of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the life history traits of P. solenopsis on Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Malvales: Malvaceae) were studied at seven constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, and 35°C) and three RHs (45, 60, and 75%). The results showed that temperature, RH, and their interactions significantly influenced the life history traits of P. solenopsis. First instar was the most sensitive stage to extreme temperatures with very low survival rates at 15 and 35°C. At 25-32.5°C and the three RHs, the developmental periods of entire immature stage were shorter with values between 12.5-18.6 d. The minimum threshold temperature and the effective accumulative temperature for the pest to complete one generation were 13.2°C and 393.7 degree-days, respectively. The percentage and longevity of female adults significantly differed among different treatments. It failed to complete development at 15 or 35°C and the three RHs. Female fecundity reached the maximum value at 27.5°C and 45% RH. The intrinsic rate for increase (r), the net reproductive rate (R0), and the finite rate of increase (λ) reached the maximum values at 27.5°C and 45% RH (0.22 d(-1), 244.6 hatched eggs, and 1.25 d(-1), respectively). Therefore, we conclude that 27.5°C and 45% RH are the optimum conditions for the population development of the pest."

            "Ultraviolet (UV) light has been used worldwide to monitor and trap insect pests. Whitefly adults show conspicuous positive phototactic behavior toward UV light stimuli; however, knowledge of the effect of UV light exposure on various life-history parameters of Dialeurodes citri remains limited. The present research aimed to investigate the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UV-A; long-wave) exposure on the reproduction and longevity of D. citri adults as well as the development of immature (eggs, larvae, and pupae) flies in the F1 generation. Paired D. citri adults were exposed to UV-A radiation for different periods (0, 1, 4, and 7 h/d) until the end of their life. The results of the experiment revealed that fecundity and oviposition rates increased when adults were irradiated for 1 and 4 h/d, but interestingly, both were significantly decreased compared with those of the controls after the longest exposure time (7 h/d). The longevity of adults of both sexes and the cumulative survival of F1 immatures were decreased with increased exposure time. Exposure to UV-A radiation prolonged the developmental time of immature stages, and a positive correlation was observed with exposure time. Exposure to UV light significantly inhibited egg hatching, larval development, pupation, and adult emergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing the effect of UV radiation on a homopteran insect pest. This research may provide a foundation for the scientific community to use UV light in the field as an integrated pest management strategy to control this devastating agricultural pest."

            "There is increasing evidence that exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides at sublethal levels impairs colonies of honeybees and other pollinators. Recently, it was found that sublethal contamination with neonicotinoids also affect growth and behavior of ants. In this study, we exposed red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, to sublethal dosages of dietary imidacloprid and investigated its effect on ant feeding, digging, and foraging behavior. S. invicta consumed significantly more sugar water containing 0.01 μg/ml imidacloprid than untreated sugar water. Ants fed with 0.01 μg/ml imidacloprid also showed significantly increased digging activity than ants fed with untreated sugar water. However, imidacloprid at ≥ 0.25 μg/ml significantly suppressed sugar water consumption, digging, and foraging behavior. These results indicate that imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations may have a significant and complicated effect on S. invicta."

            "Primary indeterminate dendritic cell tumor (IDCT) is an extremely neoplastic dendritic cell disorder. Little is known about its pathogenesis, etiology, and prognostic factors because of its rarity. Herein, we present a case report of a skin IDCT that arose in mosquito bite and discuss the correlation between hypersensitivity to mosquito bites and leukemia/lymphoma.A 28-year old man presented with multiple widespread cutaneous plaques and nodules 8 months after being bitten by a mosquito on his back. Dermatological examination revealed multiple skin-colored, well-demarcated plaques and nodules measuring approximately 0.5 to 1.8 cm in diameter all over the body. A biopsy of the skin lesion was taken. Morphologically, the dermis was effaced by round or polygonal cells with oval nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in nests and in some areas in a sheet-like pattern. The tumor cells were positive for CD68, CD1a, and S-100, whereas negative for Langerin and lack Birbeck granules ultrastructurally. A diagnosis of IDCT was made. No treatment was given. The patient was alive with spontaneous disease regression after 17 months of follow-up.IDCT is an extremely rare disease and may be associated with mosquito bite."

            "Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) have a better prognosis than those with HPV-negative tumours. There is interest in de-escalating their treatment but strategies are needed for risk stratification to identify subsets with a poor prognosis. This study investigated tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in relation to HPV tumour status and patient survival.",
            "Biopsies from 218 patients diagnosed with OPSCC between 2002 and 2011, who underwent chemo/radiotherapy were analysed for HPV by PCR, in-situ hybridisation and p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC). One hundred and thirty-nine samples with concordant HPV detection were analysed for CD3, CD4, CD8 and FoxP3 expression in tumour and stromal regions using multiplexIHC and multispectral image analysis. Labelling of smooth muscle actin (SMA) identified activated stroma.",
            "Human papillomavirus-positive compared with HPV-negative OPSCC had higher infiltration in both tumour and stromal areas of CD4 and CD8 T cells but not FoxP3 T regulatory cells. Only CD3+CD8+ stromal and not tumour area infiltration was associated with increased survival (P=0.02). There was significantly higher SMA expression in HPV-positive compared with -negative tumours, which did not correlate with survival.",

            "A divergent synthesis of α-substituted bromomethyl γ-lactones was developed, which involves the diastereoselective bromolactonization of α-substituted 4-pentenoic acids and 4-pentenamides via umpolung of bromide by use of alkali metal bromide and Oxone (potassium peroxymonosulfate mixture, 2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4) to obtain mainly cis-products from α-substituted 4-pentenoic acids and trans-products from α-substituted 4-pentenamides, and it was found that the bromonium species generated from KBr and Oxone had higher activity than N-bromosuccinimide. Furthermore, the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-dubiusamine C, which was isolated as a minor diastereomer from Pandanus dubius, was accomplished for the first time through the cis-selective bromolactonization of (S)-α-methyl-4-pentenoic acid in nine linear steps and 36% overall yield."

            "Gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas rarely metastasize to the central nervous system (CNS). The role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in patients with these cancers and CNS involvement is presently unknown.",
            "A multicentre registry was established to collect data from patients with gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas and CNS involvement both retrospectively and prospectively. Inclusion in the study required a predefined clinical data set, a central neuro-radiological or histopathological confirmation of metastatic CNS involvement and central assessment of HER2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (ISH). In addition, expression of E-cadherin and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins were assessed by IHC.",
            "One hundred patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The population's median age was 59 years (interquartile range: 54-68), of which 85 (85%) were male. Twenty-five patients were of Asian and 75 of Caucasian origin. HER2 status was positive in 36% (95% CI: 26.6-46.2) of cases. Median time from initial diagnosis to the development of brain metastases (BMets) or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) was 9.9 months (95% CI: 8.5-15.0). Median overall survival from diagnosis was 16.9 months (95% CI: 14.0-20.7) and was not related to the HER2 status. E-cadherin loss was observed in 9% of cases and loss of expression in at least one DNA MMR proteins in 6%.",
            "The proportion of a positive HER2 status in patients with gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and CNS involvement was higher than expected. The impact of anti-HER2 therapies should be studied prospectively.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 27 August 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.279 www.bjcancer.com."

            "The pathophysiology of adhesion formation after abdominal and pelvic surgery is still largely unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of macrophage polarization and the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ stimulation on adhesion formation in an animal model.",
            "Peritoneal adhesion formation was induced by the creation of ischaemic buttons within the peritoneal wall and the formation of a colonic anastomosis in wild-type, interleukin (IL) 10-deficient (IL-10(-/-) ), IL-4-deficient (IL-4(-/-) ) and CD11b-Cre/PPARγ(fl) (/fl) mice. Adhesions were assessed at regular intervals, and cell preparations were isolated from ischaemic buttons and normal peritoneum. These samples were analysed for macrophage differentiation and its markers, and expression of cytokines by quantitative PCR, fluorescence microscopy, arginase activity and pathological examination. Some animals underwent pioglitazone (PPAR-γ agonist) or vehicle treatment to inhibit adhesion formation. Anastomotic healing was evaluated by bursting pressure measurement and collagen gene expression.",
            "Macrophage M2 marker expression and arginase activity were raised in buttons without adhesions compared with buttons with adhesions. IL-4(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) mice were not affected, whereas CD11b-Cre/PPARγ(fl) (/fl) mice showed decreased arginase activity and increased adhesion formation. Perioperative pioglitazone treatment increased arginase activity and decreased adhesion formation in wild-type but not CD11b-Cre/PPARγ(fl) (/fl) mice. Pioglitazone had no effect on anastomotic healing.",
            "Endogenous macrophage-specific PPAR-γ signalling affected arginase activity and macrophage polarization, and counter-regulated peritoneal adhesion manifestation. Pharmacological PPAR-γ agonism induced a shift towards macrophage M2 polarization and ameliorated adhesion formation in a macrophage-dependent manner. Surgical relevance Postoperative adhesion formation is frequently seen after abdominal surgery and occurs in response to peritoneal trauma. The pathogenesis is still unknown but includes an imbalance in fibrinolysis, collagen production and inflammatory mechanisms. Little is known about the role of macrophages during adhesion formation. In an experimental model, macrophage M2 marker expression was associated with reduced peritoneal adhesion formation and involved PPAR-γ-mediated arginase activity. Macrophage-specific PPAR-γ deficiency resulted in reduced arginase activity and aggravated adhesion formation. Pioglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, induced M2 polarization and reduced postoperative adhesion formation without compromising anastomotic healing in mice. Pioglitazone ameliorated postoperative adhesion formation without compromising intestinal wound healing. Therefore, perioperative PPAR-γ agonism might be a promising strategy for prevention of adhesion formation after abdominal surgery."

            "This article provides an update on the role of the essential trace element selenium and its interaction with the other trace elements iodine and iron that together contribute to adequate thyroid hormone status. Synthesis, secretion, metabolism and action of thyroid hormone in target tissues depend on a balanced nutritional availability or supplementation of these elements. Selenium status is altered in benign and malignant thyroid diseases and various selenium compounds have been used to prevent or treat widespread diseases such as goiter, autoimmune thyroid disease or thyroid cancer.",
            "Several studies, most with still too low numbers of cases, indicate that selenium administration in both autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis) and mild Graves' disease improves clinical scores and well-being of patients and reduces thyroperoxidase antibody titers. However, published results are still conflicting depending on basal selenium status, dose, time and form of selenium used for intervention. Evidence for sex-specific selenium action, lack of beneficial effects in pregnancy and contribution of genetic polymorphisms (selenoprotein S) has been presented.",

            "Adolescence is regarded as a key developmental phase in the course of talented football players' careers. The present study focuses on early adolescent players' development of achievement motives, volitional components, and self-referential cognitions. Based on the multidimensional and dynamic nature of talent, the development of multifaceted personality characteristics is an important issue in the context of sports talent research. According to previous findings in psychology, personality characteristics' development is defined by both stability and change, and the current study analyses four different types: differential stability (I), mean-level change (II), individual-level change (III), and structural stability (IV). The sample consists of 151 male players in the talent development programme of the German Football Association. Psychological diagnostics of the personality characteristics are implemented across longitudinal sections over a time period of three seasons, from the U12 to U14 age classes. The results reveal that the personality characteristics show (I) moderate test-retest correlations over one-year intervals (.43 ≤ rtt ≤ .62), and lower coefficients for a two-year period (.26 ≤ rtt ≤ .53). (II) Most of the personality characteristics' mean values differ significantly across the age classes with small effect sizes (.01 ≤ [Formula: see text] ≤ .03). (III) Only minor individual-level changes in the football players' development are found. (IV) The personality characteristics' associations within a two-factor structure do not stay invariant over time. From the results of the present study, conclusions are drawn regarding the talent identification and development process."

            "Post exercise chocolate milk ingestion has been shown to enhance both glycogen resynthesis and subsequent exercise performance. To assess whether non-dairy chocolate beverage ingestion post glycogen-lowering exercise can enhance 20km cycling time trial performance 4h later. Eight healthy trained male cyclists (21.8 ± 2.3y, VO2max = 61.2 ± 1.4 ml·kg-1·min-1; mean±SD) completed a series of intense cycling intervals designed to lower muscle glycogen (Jentjens & Jeukendrup, 2003) followed by 4h of recovery and a subsequent 20km cycling time trial. During the first 2h of recovery, participants ingested chocolate dairy milk (DAIRYCHOC), chocolate soy beverage (SOYCHOC), chocolate hemp beverage (HEMPCHOC), low fat dairy milk (MILK), or a low energy artificially sweetened, flavored beverage (PLACEBO) at 30min intervals in a double blind, counterbalanced repeated measured design. All drinks, except the PLACEBO (247 kJ) were isoenergetic (2107 kJ) and all chocolate-flavoured drinks provided 1g CHO·kg body mass-1·h-1. Fluid intake across treatments was equalized (2262 ± 148 ml) by ingesting appropriate quantities of water based on drink intake. The CHO:PRO ratio was 4:1, 1.5:1, 4:1, and 6:1, for DAIRYCHOC, MILK, SOYCHOC, and HEMPCHOC, respectively. One-way Anova with repeated measures showed time trial performance (DAIRYCHOC=34.58 ± 2.5 min, SOYCHOC=34.83 ± 2.2 min, HEMPCHOC=34.88 ± 1.1 min, MILK=34.47 ± 1.7 min) was enhanced similarly vs PLACEBO (37.85 ± 2.1) for all treatments (P=0.019) These data suggest that post exercise macronutrient and total energy intake are more important for same day 20 km cycling time trial performance following glycogen-lowering exercise than protein type or protein to carbohydrate ratio."

            "Parasitism of ants that nest in rotting wood by eucharitid wasps was studied in order to examine whether habitat and season influence ant parasitism, vegetation complexity and agrochemical use correlate with ant parasitism, and whether specific local and landscape features of agricultural landscapes correlate with changes in ant parasitism. In a coffee landscape, 30 coffee and 10 forest sites were selected in which local management (e.g., vegetation, agrochemical use) and landscape features (e.g., distance to forest, percent of rustic coffee nearby) were characterized. Rotten logs were sampled and ant cocoons were collected from logs and cocoons were monitored for parasitoid emergence. Sixteen ant morphospecies in three ant subfamilies (Ectatomminae, Ponerinae, and Formicinae) were found. Seven ant species parasitized by two genera of Eucharitidae parasitoids (Kapala and Obeza) were reported and some ant-eucharitid associations were new. According to evaluated metrics, parasitism did not differ with habitat (forest, high-shade coffee, low-shade coffee), but did increase in the dry season for Gnamptogenys ants. Parasitism increased with vegetation complexity for Gnamptogenys and Pachycondyla and was high in sites with both high and low agrochemical use. Two landscape variables and two local factors positively correlated with parasitism for some ant genera and species. Thus, differences in vegetation complexity at the local and landscape scale and agrochemical use in coffee landscapes alter ecological interactions between parasitoids and their ant hosts."

            "Modulating the gut microbiota via dietary interventions is a common strategy to enhance the natural defence mechanisms of the host. Several in vitro studies have highlighted the probiotic potential of Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 (RBL67) selected for its anti-Salmonella effects. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of RBL67 alone and combined with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on the gut microbiota of Göttingen minipigs. Minipigs were fed a basal diet supplemented with 8 g/d probiotic powder (1×109 CFU/g in skim milk matrix) (probiotic diet (PRO)), 8 g/d probiotic powder plus 8 g/d FOS (synbiotic diet (SYN)) or 8 g/d skim milk powder (control), following a cross-sectional study design. Faecal and caecal microbiota compositions were analysed with pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR. Metabolic activity in the caecum and colon was measured by HPLC. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that minipig faeces show close similarity to pig microbiota. During the treatments and at the time of killing of animals, RBL67 was consistently detected in faeces, caecum and colon at numbers of 105-106 16S rRNA copies/g content after feeding PRO and SYN diets. At the time of killing of animals, significantly higher Bifidobacterium numbers in the caecum and colon of SYN-fed minipigs were measured compared with PRO. Our data indicate that the Göttingen minipig may be a suitable model for gut microbiota research in pigs. Data from this first in vivo study of RBL67 colonisation suggest that the combination with FOS may represent a valuable symbiotic strategy to increase probiotic bacteria levels and survival in gastrointestinal tracts for feed and food applications."

            "The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a phloem-feeding, economically important pest of crops worldwide. In addition to direct damage, it also vectors a number of plant viruses belonging to the family Geminiviridae. Its populations differ biologically with respect to insecticide resistance, virus transmission and host range. Therefore, understanding genetic variation among populations is important for management. We sequenced 850 bp of the mitochondrial COI (mtCOI) gene from B. tabaci populations surveyed across India. BLAST analysis of the mtCOI sequences generated in this study with sequences from the mtCOI dataset showed the presence of one invasive group, MEAM1, and eight other groups of B. tabaci in India. mtCOI sequence analyses showed the presence of Asia I, Asia I-India, Asia II-1, Asia II-5, Asia II-7, Asia II-8, and Asia II-11 genetic groups. We also found China-3 in a field in Birbhum district, West Bengal, India, suggesting a role of anthropogenic activities in the distribution of B. tabaci. Interestingly, more than one genetic group was found coexisting in the same field."
